/*  
 * to find the GCD
 * 
 * Intuition: Oh to solve this question we must have clear idea of Euclidean Algorithm.
 * Dont worry here's what it is: 
 * Letâ€™s say we want to find the GCD of 48 and 18.
   Divide 48 by 18: the remainder is 12 (since 48 = 18 Ã— 2 + 12).
   Now, replace 48 with 18 and 18 with 12. So, divide 18 by 12: the remainder is 6.
   Replace 18 with 12 and 12 with 6. Divide 12 by 6: the remainder is 0.
   Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 6.

   our GCD function is getting two terms n1 and n2..if n2 is zero GCD(anything,0) = anything
   and if n!=0 then simply the n1 becomes n2 and n2 becomes the remainder of n1 and n2.
